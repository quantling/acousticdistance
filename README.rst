At the moment this is supplementary material for the presentation of "Phonetic
distances in L3-speech" of the ESSV2025 (https://www.essv.de/essv2025/).

This is a loose reimplementation of the ideas in 

https://github.com/Bartelds/neural-acoustic-distance

and

https://github.com/Bartelds/acoustic-distance-measure

as a python module with a minimal set of additional software needed.

Furthermore, it includes all the additional scripts to re-run the distance
calculations and the data analysis.

Due to privacy reasons the data is not included in the repository.
